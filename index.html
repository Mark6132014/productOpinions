                You know, actually. This is just nothing, a waste of money. Kids know Halloween.
                <br>
                Halloween is scary, funny, and with joy. But that, waste of money! The kids already get it.
                <br>
                So, no need. Without it, some halloween decorations that you got can blend in the Halloween spirit!
                <br>
                Just being honest with you, <span style="font-size: 2em; color: orange;">HALLOWEEN IS FUN!</span>

                Another Halloween product, huh? Great! I will say my opinion:
                <br>
                FunFetti sounds like that Halloween Candy thingies that are orange, yellow, and white.
                <br>
                But mostly sounds like Jelly beans.
                <br>
                But no offense on the product, cupcakes are not a good idea for Halloween.
                <br>
                I mean, it is supposed to be candy, like Trick or Treat, then give the candy.
                <br>
                Not Trick or Bake! It is a bad idea because imagine if the child accidently drops
                <br>
                the cupcake.

               That product sounds funny, but 50% weird, 50/50.
               <br>
               My opinion is:
               <br>
               Don't tell me the pills really have a side-effect though.
               <br>
               About a couple of years ago, I saw on Amazon, called a "Fart machine #2".
               <br>
               So, I am not trying to be weird, but what happened to "Fart machine #1"?
               <br>
               And what happened to "The original Fart machine", too?

               But I know it is spicy, though!

               #6: I'd rather eat real bacon for my classic breakfast!
               <br>
               But in a liquid, not for breakfast, not for lunch, and not even for dinner!

                So, I guess it looks like the flavor of the bacon came from real pigsüêñ

                or artifical flavors.
